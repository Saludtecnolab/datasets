Problem Statement and Objective A hospital readmission is when a patient who is discharged from the hospital,
gets re-admitted again within a certain period of time. Hospital readmission rates for certain conditions are
now considered an indicator of hospital quality, and also affect the cost of care adversely. For this reason, 
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services established the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program which aims to 
improve quality of care for patients and reduce health care spending by applying payment penalties to hospitals 
that have more than expected readmission rates for certain conditions. Although diabetes is not yet included in 
the penalty measures, the program is regularly adding new disease conditions to the list, now totaling 6 for FY2018. 
In 2011, American hospitals spent over $41 billion on diabetic patients who got readmitted within 30 days of discharge.
Being able to determine factors that lead to higher readmission in such patients, and correspondingly being able 
to predict which patients will get readmitted can help hospitals save millions of dollars while improving quality of care.
So, with that background in mind, we used a medical claims dataset (description below), to answer these questions:

What factors are the strongest predictors of hospital readmission in diabetic patients?
How well can we predict hospital readmission in this dataset with limited features?

In this database, you have 3 different outputs:

No readmission;
A readmission in less than 30 days (this situation is not good, because maybe your treatment was not appropriate);
A readmission in more than 30 days (this one is not so good as well the last one, however, the reason can be the state of the patient.
